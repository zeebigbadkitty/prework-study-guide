# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I wanted to build a study guide that I can use as a companion throughout my pre-work. It helped me keep all my information in one place and build code along side it. I learned an expanded set of definitions and commands from what I knew previously.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Use this as your companion during your pre-work by documenting notes as you come across them; JavaScript console included with random array.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
