# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I wanted to build a study guide that I can use as a companion throughout my pre-work. It helped me keep all my information in one place and build code along side it. I learned an expanded set of definitions and commands from what I knew previously.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Use this as your companion during your pre-work by documenting notes as you come across them; JavaScript console included with random array.
